# Where I keep track of my project

10/31
First, I ran FASTQC on the raw files: WTC2_1.fq.gz and WTC2_2.fq.gz

11/5
Using the FASTQC results, I designed a trimmomatic script (Trimmomatic Script 10.31) to address the quality issues that appeared in the FASTQC analysis. I ran the output of the trimmomatic job through FASTQC to ensure that the trimming had worked.
