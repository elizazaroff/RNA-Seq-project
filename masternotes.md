## Quality Control: FastQC & Trimmomatic
10/31: 
First, I ran FASTQC on the raw files: WTC2_1.fq.gz and WTC2_2.fq.gz

Using the FASTQC results, I designed a trimmomatic script (Trimmomatic Script 10.31) to address the quality issues that appeared in the FASTQC analysis. Then, I ran the paired end output files through FASTQC to ensure that the trimming and quality control had worked.
