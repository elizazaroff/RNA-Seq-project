# RNA-Seq-project
This is my RNA seq project for my fall 2024 genomics/bioinformatics course

Background: Candida albicans: a commensal yeast that that can cause a variety of pathologies- i.e., urinary tract, genital, mucosal and blood infections. The Rolfes lab seeks to understand how C. albicans shifts from its commensal form to its pathogenic form, insights that can inform intervention efforts. Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is a growth factor for C. albicans. As such, understanding changes in gene expression in the presence of Thiamine will allow for the classification of specific genes that encode for growth and later pathogenicity. 

Experimental Design: One strain grown in presence of thiamine; one strain grown in the absense of thiamine. There are three biological replicates for each condition, with two read pairs for each replicate, resulting in 12 total sequence files. 

Analysis goals:

Data files: I'll be analyzing the WTC2_1.fq.gz and WTC2_2.fq.gz read pair. I'll be using NCBI's reference genome sequence and gtf annotation file for Candida albicans (GCF_000182965.3).
