# RNA-Seq-project
This is my RNA seq project for my fall 2024 genomics/bioinformatics course

Background: Candida albicans: a commensal yeast that that can cause a variety of pathologies- i.e., urinary tract, genital, mucosal and blood infections. The Rolfes lab seeks to understand the biochemical pathways of C. albicans, in order to identify possible drug targets.
Experimental Design: One strain grown in presence of thiamine; one strain grown in the absense of thiamine. There are three biological replicates for each condition, with two read pairs for each replicate, resulting in 12 total sequence files. 
Analysis goals:
Data files: I'll be analyzing the WTC2_1.fq.gz and WTC2_2.fq.gz read pair.
